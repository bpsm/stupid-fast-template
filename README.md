# Stupid-Fast Template

A Clojure library designed to be stupid and fast. Mostly stupid
right. Not currently suitable for actual use.

When I say I intend it to be fast, I mean that I intend to apply the
dark macrological arts to move as much work as sensible to compile
time on a case-by-case basis.

## Usage

Use the source, Luke!
